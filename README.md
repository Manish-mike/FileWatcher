# FileWatcher
File Watchers monitor directories on the file system and perform specific actions when desired files appear. When new or updated files appear in a monitored directory, a specified pipeline task (or set of tasks) will be triggered. Multiple File Watchers can be set up to monitor a single directory for file changes, or each File Watcher could watch a different location.
